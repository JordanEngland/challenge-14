# MVC Tech Blog/Challenge-14


## Description

This project involves the development of a CMS-style tech blog, where developers can create and publish articles, blog posts, and opinions related to technology. Utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, the application employs technologies such as Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for database interaction, and Express.js for building the web server. The project also implements user authentication through the express-session package, enabling users to register, log in, and log out. The blog site features navigation between homepage and dashboard, with functionalities like creating, editing, and deleting posts, leaving comments on posts, and session management for security.
